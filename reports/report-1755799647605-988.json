The use of `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` for testing and `test_array.copy()` demonstrates good practices for modularity and preventing unintended side effects during testing.\n-   **Documentation**: The function has a concise yet informative docstring that accurately describes its purpose and explicitly states its time and space complexities.\n\n## 🔄 Areas for Improvement  \n-   **Algorithm Efficiency**: While the implementation of Bubble Sort itself is correct and optimized, Bubble Sort is inherently inefficient (O(n^2) worst-case time complexity) compared to other sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort for general-purpose use. This limits its practical applicability for large datasets.\n-   **Error Handling**: The function lacks input validation. It assumes `arr` is a list and that its elements are comparable. Providing non-list input or a list with non-comparable mixed types would lead to runtime errors (e.g., `TypeError`).\n-   **Type Hinting**: The code does not utilize type hints, which can significantly improve code readability, make interfaces clearer, and enable static analysis tools to catch potential errors.\n\n## 💡 Recommendations\n### High Priority:\n1.  **Add Type Hints**: Enhance code clarity and maintainability by adding type hints to function parameters and return values.\n    ```python\n    def bubble_sort(arr: list) -> list:\n        # ... function body ...\n        return arr\n    ```\n2.  **Implement Basic Input Validation**: Add checks to ensure the input `arr` is indeed a list. While not strictly necessary for simple demonstration code, it makes the function more robust in a production environment.\n    ```python\n    def bubble_sort(arr: list) -> list:\n        if not isinstance(arr, list):\n            raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list.\")\n        # ... rest of the code ...\n    ```\n\n### Medium Priority:\n1.  **Consider Alternative Algorithms for General Sorting**: For real-world applications requiring efficient sorting of large datasets, consider using Python's built-in `list.sort()` or `sorted()` functions, which are highly optimized (Timsort, O(n log n)), or implementing other O(n log n) algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort if the goal is to learn different algorithm paradigms.\n\n### Low Priority:\n1.  No significant low-priority recommendations for this specific, well-implemented Bubble Sort function.\n\n---\n\n## 📈 Performance Analysis\n-   **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst and average cases. In the best case (when the array is already sorted), the early exit optimization reduces it to O(n) as it only performs one full pass.\n-   **Space Complexity**: O(1), as it sorts the array in-place and uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like `n`, `i`, `j`, and `swapped`.\n-   **Scalability**: Poor. Due to its quadratic time complexity, the execution time grows rapidly with the size of the input array, making it unsuitable for large datasets.\n\n## 🎯 Summary\nThe provided Python code is an excellent and well-structured implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm, complete with a valuable early-exit optimization and clear documentation. While its inherent O(n^2) time complexity limits its scalability for large datasets, the code serves as a superb example for understanding Bubble Sort principles, demonstrating strong code quality and adherence to several best practices.",
