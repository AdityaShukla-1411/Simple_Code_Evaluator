This can be desirable for immutability.\n\n## Areas for Improvement:\n*   **Algorithm Efficiency (Space Complexity)**: This implementation creates new `left` and `right` arrays in each recursive call. This leads to `O(N)` auxiliary space complexity in the average case (and worst case), which negates QuickSort's typical advantage of being an in-place sort with `O(log N)` auxiliary space (due to recursion stack).\n*   **Algorithm Efficiency (Time Complexity for Identical Elements)**: The partitioning strategy places all elements equal to or greater than the pivot into the `right` array. If the input array contains many identical elements (e.g., `[5, 5, 5, 5]`), this leads to an extremely unbalanced partition where `left` is empty and `right` contains `N-1` elements. This degenerates the algorithm to `O(N^2)` time complexity in such cases, rather than the expected `O(N log N)`.\n*   **Pivot Selection**: Using `Math.floor(arr.length / 2)` as a pivot is simple but can lead to worst-case `O(N^2)` time complexity for certain ordered or reverse-ordered inputs, depending on the exact partitioning scheme.\n*   **Partitioning Logic**: The explicit check `if (i === Math.floor(arr.length / 2)) continue;` to skip the pivot element in the loop is slightly awkward. More common partitioning schemes (like Hoare or Lomuto) handle the pivot more elegantly within the two-pointer approach, often swapping it to an end or using it directly in comparisons without explicit skipping.\n*   **Error Handling/Robustness**:\n    *   No input validation: The function assumes `arr` is an array of comparable elements. Passing `null`, `undefined`, or an array with mixed types (e.g., numbers and objects, or strings that don't compare numerically) could lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.\n    *   No handling for non-comparable types: `arr[i] < pivot` relies on the default JavaScript comparison, which might not be suitable for complex objects.\n*   **Documentation**: The code lacks any comments or JSDoc. While the function is relatively simple, a brief description of its purpose, parameters, and return value, along with notes on its time/space complexity, would greatly improve clarity for maintainers.\n*   **Extensibility**: The function is hardcoded for numerical comparison. It cannot easily be extended to sort objects by a specific property or to use a custom comparison logic without modifying the core `if (arr[i] < pivot)` line.\n\n## Recommendations:\n1.  **Implement In-Place Partitioning**: For better space efficiency, consider implementing a classic in-place QuickSort partitioning scheme (e.g., Hoare or Lomuto). This typically involves using two pointers and swapping elements within the original array, rather than creating new `left` and `right` arrays. This would change the space complexity to `O(log N)` on average.\n2.  **Handle Duplicate Elements Gracefully**: Modify the partitioning logic to distribute elements equal to the pivot into *both* `left` and `right` partitions, or ideally, place them directly next to the pivot. This prevents `O(N^2)` worst-case scenarios when dealing with arrays containing many identical values. A common approach is to have three partitions: `less`, `equal`, `greater`.\n3.  **Improve Pivot Selection**: Implement a more robust pivot selection strategy, such as:\n    *   **Random Pivot**: Select a random element as the pivot to mitigate worst-case scenarios for specific input patterns.\n    *   **Median-of-Three**: Choose the median of the first, middle, and last elements as the pivot.\n4.  **Add Input Validation**: Before proceeding, check if `arr` is indeed an array.\n    ```javascript\n    function quickSort(arr) {\n        if (!Array.isArray(arr)) {\n            throw new TypeError(\"Input must be an array.\");\n        }\n        // ... rest of the code\n    }\n    ```\n5.  **Add Documentation**: Include JSDoc comments to describe the function's purpose, parameters, return value, and any important notes about its complexity or limitations.\n    ```javascript\n    /**\n     * Sorts an array of numbers using the QuickSort algorithm.\n     * Note: This implementation is not in-place and has O(N) space complexity.\n     * It may also perform poorly (O(N^2)) with arrays containing many duplicate elements.\n     *\n     * @param {number[]} arr - The array of numbers to sort.\n     * @returns {number[]} A new sorted array.\n     */\n    function quickSort(arr) {\n        // ...\n    }\n    ```\n6.  **Enable Custom Comparators (Optional but Recommended)**: To make the function more versatile, allow a custom comparison function to be passed as an argument.\n    ```javascript\n    function quickSort(arr, comparator = (a, b) => a - b) {\n        // ...\n        // In the loop: if (comparator(arr[i], pivot) < 0) { ... }\n        // ...\n    }\n    ```\n\n## Code Rating: Fair",
