The code is concise and directly mirrors the mathematical definition of the Fibonacci sequence.\n    *   **Structure**: Simple and clear single-function structure.\n    *   **Naming**: `fibonacci` and `n` are perfectly descriptive and adhere to standard conventions.\n- **Algorithm Efficiency**: 3/20 (time/space complexity)\n    *   **Time Complexity**: O(2^n). This is extremely inefficient due to redundant calculations of the same Fibonacci numbers multiple times. For `n=10`, it's acceptable, but for `n=20`, it becomes noticeably slow, and for `n=40` or higher, it's practically unusable.\n    *   **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the depth of the recursion stack.\n- **Best Practices**: 7/20 (language conventions, patterns)\n    *   **Language Conventions**: Adheres to standard JavaScript function declaration.\n    *   **Patterns**: While direct recursion is a valid programming technique, using it naively for the Fibonacci sequence without memoization is generally considered an anti-pattern in performance-critical scenarios due to its exponential time complexity. It misses common algorithmic patterns like dynamic programming or an iterative approach for this specific problem.\n- **Error Handling**: 2/15 (robustness, edge cases)\n    *   **Robustness**: Very brittle. It handles the base cases `n <= 1` correctly for non-negative integers.\n    *   **Edge Cases**: Fails dramatically for negative inputs (e.g., `fibonacci(-1)` leads to infinite recursion and a stack overflow). It also does not validate for non-integer inputs (e.g., `fibonacci(3.5)` would also lead to infinite recursion).\n- **Documentation**: 5/15 (comments, clarity)\n    *   **Comments**: None.\n    *   **Clarity**: The code's simplicity makes it inherently clear for this specific problem. However, for a professional codebase, it lacks any form of documentation (e.g., JSDoc) explaining its purpose, parameters, return value, or known limitations (like performance).\n- **Maintainability**: 5/10 (modularity, extensibility)\n    *   **Modularity**: The function is a self-contained unit.\n    *   **Extensibility**: The current recursive approach forms the core logic. To significantly improve its efficiency (e.g., to handle larger `n`), a fundamental change to the algorithm (like memoization or iteration) would be required, rather than minor extensions.\n\n## Strengths:\n-   **Readability**: The code is exceptionally clear and directly reflects the mathematical definition of the Fibonacci sequence, making it easy to understand for anyone familiar with the concept.\n-   **Conciseness**: It's a very compact implementation.\n-   **Correctness for Base Cases**: Handles `n=0` and `n=1` correctly, which are the fundamental base cases for the sequence.\n-   **Clear Naming**: The function and parameter names are intuitive and follow standard JavaScript conventions.\n\n## Areas for Improvement:\n-   **Performance**: The most significant weakness is its exponential time complexity, making it impractical for inputs `n > 20-25`.\n-   **Error Handling/Input Validation**: It lacks robustness for invalid inputs, specifically negative numbers or non-integers, leading to stack overflows.\n-   **Algorithmic Choice**: While mathematically elegant, direct recursion is an inefficient choice for Fibonacci in practice due to redundant computations.\n-   **Documentation**: Absence of any comments or JSDoc, which is crucial for larger projects or shared codebases.\n\n## Recommendations:\n-   **Improve Efficiency with Memoization or Iteration**:\n    *   **Memoized Recursion (Dynamic Programming)**: Cache already computed Fibonacci numbers to avoid redundant calculations. This changes time complexity to O(n) and space complexity to O(n).\n        ```javascript\n        function fibonacciMemoized(n, memo = {}) {\n            if (n in memo) return memo[n];\n            if (n <= 1) return n;\n            memo[n] = fibonacciMemoized(n - 1, memo) + fibonacciMemoized(n - 2, memo);\n            return memo[n];\n        }\n        ```\n    *   **Iterative Approach**: This is often the most efficient for Fibonacci, achieving O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.\n        ```javascript\n        function fibonacciIterative(n) {\n            if (n < 0) {\n                // handle error or return specific value\n                throw new Error(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\");\n            }\n            if (n <= 1) return n;\n\n            let a = 0, b = 1;\n            for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n                let temp = a + b;\n                a = b;\n                b = temp;\n            }\n            return b;\n        }\n        ```\n-   **Add Robust Input Validation**: Before performing calculations, validate `n` to ensure it is a non-negative integer. Throw an error or return a sensible value for invalid inputs.\n    ```javascript\n    function fibonacci(n) {\n        if (!Number.isInteger(n) || n < 0) {\n            throw new Error(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\");\n        }\n        // ... rest of the logic ...\n    }\n    ```\n-   **Implement JSDoc Comments**: Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to describe the function's purpose, parameters, return value, and potential performance notes.\n    ```javascript\n    /**\n     * Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a naive recursive approach.\n     * WARNING: This implementation is highly inefficient for n > ~20 due to exponential time complexity.\n     * Consider `fibonacciMemoized` or `fibonacciIterative` for better performance.\n     *\n     * @param {number} n The index of the Fibonacci number to calculate (must be a non-negative integer).\n     * @returns {number} The nth Fibonacci number.\n     * @throws {Error} If the input is not a non-negative integer.\n     */\n    function fibonacci(n) {\n        // ...\n    }\n    ```\n\n## Code Rating: Fair\n\nThe code is correct for its intended (limited) purpose and demonstrates excellent readability. However, its severe performance limitations for larger inputs and lack of robust error handling make it unsuitable for most practical applications without significant modifications. It serves as a good educational example of a simple recursive definition but highlights the importance of understanding algorithmic efficiency.",
