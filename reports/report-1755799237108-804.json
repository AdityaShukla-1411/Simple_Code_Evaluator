This is generally a good practice for predictability and avoiding side effects.\n*   **Conceptually Sound:** The implementation correctly applies the quicksort divide-and-conquer strategy, partitioning elements based on a pivot and recursively sorting sub-arrays.\n\n## Areas for Improvement:\n*   **Space Complexity (Not In-Place):** This implementation is not an \"in-place\" sort. It creates new `left` and `right` arrays in each recursive call, leading to a space complexity of O(N) in the average case (due to array copying) and O(N) for the call stack in the worst case, rather than the O(log N) average space (for call stack) and O(1) auxiliary space (for partitioning) typical of an efficient quicksort. This can be a significant performance bottleneck for large datasets due to memory allocations and garbage collection.\n*   **Pivot Selection Strategy:** Choosing the middle element (`arr[Math.floor(arr.length / 2)]`) as the pivot can lead to worst-case O(N^2) time complexity for already sorted, reverse-sorted, or nearly sorted arrays.\n*   **Inefficient Pivot Handling in Loop:** The line `if (i === Math.floor(arr.length / 2)) continue;` recalculates `Math.floor(arr.length / 2)` in every iteration of the loop, which is a minor inefficiency. More importantly, excluding the pivot explicitly and then concatenating it back is less efficient than partitioning in a way that places the pivot in its final sorted position within the array.\n*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code assumes `arr` is an array of comparable elements. It does not handle cases where `arr` is not an array, is `null`/`undefined`, or contains mixed types (e.g., objects, booleans) that cannot be reliably compared using `<`. This makes the function brittle.\n*   **No Documentation:** There are no comments or JSDoc annotations to explain the function's purpose, its parameters, return value, or its time/space complexity. This hinders understanding and maintainability for others (or future self).\n*   **Potential for Stack Overflow:** For very large arrays, deep recursion might lead to a \"Maximum call stack size exceeded\" error, although JavaScript engines often have large stack limits.\n\n## Recommendations:\n1.  **Implement In-Place Partitioning:** Refactor the `quickSort` to use an in-place partitioning scheme (e.g., Hoare's partition scheme or Lomuto's partition scheme). This significantly reduces space complexity to O(log N) for the call stack (average case) and O(1) auxiliary space for partitioning, which is a key advantage of quicksort.\n    *   *Example Idea (Conceptual, Hoare's)*:\n        ```javascript\n        function quickSortInPlace(arr, low = 0, high = arr.length - 1) {\n            if (low < high) {\n                const pivotIndex = partition(arr, low, high);\n                quickSortInPlace(arr, low, pivotIndex); // Or pivotIndex - 1 depending on partition logic\n                quickSortInPlace(arr, pivotIndex + 1, high);\n            }\n            return arr;\n        }\n\n        function partition(arr, low, high) {\n            const pivot = arr[Math.floor((low + high) / 2)]; // Or random pivot\n            let i = low - 1;\n            let j = high + 1;\n            while (true) {\n                do { i++; } while (arr[i] < pivot);\n                do { j--; } while (arr[j] > pivot);\n                if (i >= j) return j;\n                [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]]; // Swap\n            }\n        }\n        ```\n2.  **Improve Pivot Selection:** To mitigate the worst-case O(N^2) time complexity, consider:\n    *   **Random Pivot:** Select a random element as the pivot. This makes the worst-case unlikely in practice.\n    *   **Median-of-Three:** Choose the median of the first, middle, and last elements as the pivot. This provides a better estimate of the true median, reducing the chance of bad partitions.\n3.  **Add Input Validation:** Before processing the array, add checks to ensure `arr` is indeed an array and its elements are of a comparable type.\n    ```javascript\n    function quickSort(arr) {\n        if (!Array.isArray(arr)) {\n            throw new TypeError(\"Input must be an array.\");\n        }\n        // ... rest of the code\n    }\n    ```\n4.  **Add Documentation:** Include JSDoc comments to describe the function's purpose, parameters, return value, and expected time/space complexity.\n    ```javascript\n    /**\n     * Sorts an array of comparable elements using the QuickSort algorithm.\n     * Note: This implementation is not in-place and creates new arrays for partitioning.\n     * @param {Array<number>} arr The array to sort. Assumes elements are numbers or comparable.\n     * @returns {Array<number>} A new, sorted array.\n     * @complexity Time: O(n log n) average, O(n^2) worst. Space: O(n) average/worst.\n     */\n    function quickSort(arr) { /* ... */ }\n    ```\n5.  **Optimize Pivot Index Calculation:** Store the pivot index in a `const` variable before the loop to avoid recalculating it repeatedly.\n    ```javascript\n    const pivotIndex = Math.floor(arr.length / 2);\n    const pivot = arr[pivotIndex];\n    // ...\n    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n        if (i === pivotIndex) continue;\n        // ...\n    }\n    ```\n\n## Code Rating: Fair",
