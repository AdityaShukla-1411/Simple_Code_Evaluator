Variable names (`arr`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `swapped`) are standard and clear for the context.\n*   **Pythonic Style:** The use of tuple assignment (`arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]`) for swapping elements is idiomatic Python.\n*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** The function includes a clear docstring that accurately states the general time and space complexities. Inline comments are judiciously used to explain the logic of different parts of the algorithm, enhancing understanding without being redundant.\n*   **Modularity and Testing:** The sorting logic is encapsulated in a function, and a well-structured test case is provided within an `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, which is standard practice. The test case correctly uses `test_array.copy()` to avoid modifying the original list.\n*   **Edge Case Handling (Implicit):** The code correctly handles edge cases like an empty list (`[]`) or a single-element list (`[5]`) due to the loop ranges. It also handles already-sorted arrays efficiently because of the `swapped` flag.\n\n## Areas for Improvement:\n*   **Input Validation:** The function assumes `arr` is a list (or at least a mutable sequence) whose elements are comparable. There's no explicit check for `None` input or non-list types, which could lead to a `TypeError` or `AttributeError`.\n*   **Docstring Completeness (Minor):** While the O(n^2) complexity is correct for the worst/average case, the docstring could optionally mention the best-case O(n) complexity due to the optimization, for a more complete picture.\n\n## Recommendations:\n*   **Add Input Validation:** To make the function more robust, consider adding checks at the beginning of `bubble_sort` to ensure `arr` is a list and optionally, that its elements are of comparable types (though this can be tricky to validate generically).\n    ```python\n    def bubble_sort(arr):\n        \"\"\"\n        Bubble sort implementation\n        Time complexity: O(n^2) (Worst/Average), O(n) (Best - nearly sorted)\n        Space complexity: O(1)\n        \"\"\"\n        if not isinstance(arr, list):\n            raise TypeError(\"Input must be a list.\")\n        # Optional: More granular checks for element types if specific types are expected.\n        # However, Python's duck typing often means this isn't strictly necessary unless\n        # specific errors need to be caught early.\n\n        n = len(arr)\n        # ... rest of the code\n    ```\n*   **Consider Type Hints:** For improved readability and maintainability, especially in larger codebases or collaborative projects, adding type hints would be beneficial.\n    ```python\n    from typing import List, TypeVar, Comparable\n\n    T = TypeVar('T', bound=Comparable) # If using Python 3.8+, or define comparison protocol\n    # For simplicity, often just use TypeVar('T') and rely on runtime errors for non-comparable types\n\n    def bubble_sort(arr: List[T]) -> List[T]:\n        # ...\n    ```\n*   **Update Docstring (Optional):** As mentioned, you could expand the time complexity note in the docstring to include the best-case scenario.\n    ```python\n    \"\"\"\n    Bubble sort implementation\n    Time complexity: O(n^2) (worst/average case), O(n) (best case - array already sorted)\n    Space complexity: O(1)\n    \"\"\"\n    ```\n\n## Code Rating: Excellent",
