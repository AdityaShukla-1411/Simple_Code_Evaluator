This makes it easy to understand the core logic of the recursive QuickSort.\n*   **Correctness:** For basic numeric arrays, the function correctly sorts the input array.\n*   **Purity:** The function is a pure function; it does not modify the original input array (`arr`), which is a good functional programming practice and improves predictability and testability.\n*   **Base Case Handling:** The base case `if (arr.length <= 1) { return arr; }` is correctly implemented, ensuring the recursion terminates for empty or single-element arrays.\n\n## Areas for Improvement:\n*   **Space Complexity:** This implementation is not an \"in-place\" QuickSort. It creates new `left` and `right` arrays in each recursive call, leading to O(N) auxiliary space complexity in the average case (where N is the number of elements), and potentially O(N^2) in the worst case if the array is continuously partitioned into N-1 and 1 element sub-arrays. Standard QuickSort implementations aim for O(log N) average space complexity due to recursion stack depth.\n*   **Efficiency of Partitioning:** The repeated creation of new arrays and the use of the spread operator (`...`) for concatenation introduce significant overhead due to memory allocation and copying, making it less efficient than an in-place partitioning approach.\n*   **Pivot Selection Strategy:** Choosing the middle element as the pivot is simple but can lead to O(N^2) worst-case performance for certain input patterns (e.g., already sorted arrays or arrays with many duplicates). More robust strategies like \"median-of-three\" or random pivot selection are generally preferred.\n*   **Handling of Duplicates:** Elements equal to the pivot are all placed in the `right` partition. While this works, it can lead to unbalanced partitions if there are many duplicate elements, potentially degrading performance. A 3-way partition (less, equal, greater) is more efficient for duplicates.\n*   **Lack of Documentation:** There are no in-code comments or JSDoc-style comments explaining the function's purpose, parameters, return value, or any specific assumptions/behavior (e.g., about time/space complexity, or non-numeric inputs).\n*   **Extensibility:** The function is not easily extensible. It hardcodes the comparison `arr[i] < pivot`, making it suitable only for primitive types that support standard less-than comparison. It cannot be used to sort objects or arrays requiring custom comparison logic without modification.\n*   **Robustness to Non-Numeric Input:** The code implicitly assumes that array elements are comparable using `<`. If the array contains elements that are not numbers or strings (e.g., `null`, `undefined`, custom objects without valueOf/toString), the comparison might lead to unpredictable results (`false`) or runtime errors. For example, `NaN` values will always end up in the `right` array as `NaN < x` is always `false`.\n\n## Recommendations:\n*   **Implement In-Place QuickSort:** For optimal space efficiency, consider implementing QuickSort using an in-place partitioning scheme (e.g., Lomuto's or Hoare's partition schemes). This involves modifying the original array by swapping elements and typically uses a helper function with `low` and `high` index parameters: `quickSort(arr, low, high)`.\n*   **Improve Pivot Selection:** To mitigate worst-case performance, implement a more robust pivot selection strategy:\n    *   **Median-of-Three:** Choose the median of the first, middle, and last elements to reduce the chance of picking an extreme value.\n    *   **Random Pivot:** Select a random element as the pivot for better average-case performance across various inputs.\n*   **Optimize Duplicate Handling:** For arrays with many duplicate elements, consider a 3-way partitioning scheme (e.g., Dijkstra's Dutch National Flag algorithm), which partitions elements into \"less than pivot\", \"equal to pivot\", and \"greater than pivot\" sections. This keeps duplicates grouped together and can significantly improve performance.\n*   **Add JSDoc Comments:** Provide clear and concise comments using JSDoc syntax to explain the function's purpose, parameters, return value, algorithm's characteristics (time/space complexity), and any specific behaviors or limitations.\n    ```javascript\n    /**\n     * Sorts an array of comparable elements using the QuickSort algorithm.\n     * This implementation is NOT in-place and creates new arrays for partitions.\n     *\n     * @param {Array<number>} arr - The array to be sorted.\n     * @returns {Array<number>} A new sorted array.\n     * @complexity Time: Average O(n log n), Worst O(n^2). Space: O(n) auxiliary.\n     */\n    function quickSort(arr) { /* ... */ }\n    ```\n*   **Support Custom Comparators:** Make the function more flexible by allowing an optional `comparator` function as an argument, similar to `Array.prototype.sort()`. This enables sorting of custom objects or using different sorting criteria.\n    ```javascript\n    function quickSort(arr, comparator = (a, b) => a - b) { // Or a default (a, b) => a < b ? -1 : (a > b ? 1 : 0)\n        if (arr.length <= 1) {\n            return arr;\n        }\n        const pivot = arr[Math.floor(arr.length / 2)];\n        const left = [];\n        const right = [];\n        const equals = []; // For 3-way partitioning\n\n        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n            const comparison = comparator(arr[i], pivot);\n            if (comparison < 0) { // arr[i] < pivot\n                left.push(arr[i]);\n            } else if (comparison > 0) { // arr[i] > pivot\n                right.push(arr[i]);\n            } else { // arr[i] === pivot\n                equals.push(arr[i]);\n            }\n        }\n        // return [...quickSort(left, comparator), pivot, ...quickSort(right, comparator)]; // Old way\n        return [...quickSort(left, comparator), ...equals, ...quickSort(right, comparator)]; // With equals\n    }\n    ```\n*   **Input Validation (Optional):** For a production-grade utility, consider adding explicit checks for input types if specific behavior is required for non-array inputs or non-comparable array elements.\n\n## Code Rating: Good",
